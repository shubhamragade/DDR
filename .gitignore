# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is individual or
#   project-specific. In a workflow or for a web application, you might want to keep runtime.txt for Heroku

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install.
